        <p>I've had a passion for programming since Scratch was introduced to us in elementary school. Creating games with some friends became a daily passion that has manifested into a passion for programming and learning about computers that has shaped who I am today. </p>
		<p>
			 I spent my time in middle school doing robotics where I got to learn about communication and teamwork. My experience not only gave me a very good platform to better my skills as a programmer but also helped me understand how I had to change my methods to ensure that the team always came first. I developed the software that ran our robot and qualified us for states all 3 years. During my time I got very familiar with Java which was the language that ran our robot.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 In highschool, I spent my time working on projects for my family. I spent a lot of my time with my Raspberry Pi that had running webservers 24/7. I had discovered how to host websites and immediately learned as much as I could about HTML, Javascript, JQuery, and CSS. Once I discovered PHP and the ability to interact with the actual computer using a website I began learning about C++, Bash, Python, and all those small scripting languages like Visual Basic Script.

            A Little About Me

		<h3>
			Hi! I am currently a sophmore at Michigan State University
		</h3>
		<h3>
			 planning on majoring in Computer Science and Math.
		</h3>
      <div class="glob">
		  <div class="image left"><img src="images/pic09.jpg" alt="picture of me!" /></div>
         <p>Currently, I'm developing projects and learning as much as I can about industry-level software engineering while fueling my passion for using my skills to make life easier and more enjoyable for me and my friends. The past couple years I have spent exploring different aspects of Engineering that helped me understand more about computers and the future of technology (AI and Machine Learning and all that cool stuff).
		 </p>
		 <p>
			 The projects I have here are the ones I'm most passionate about and all of them have a reason for why I made them. I hope one day to be able to say that I get to do what I love as my career and I'm extremely excited to see what the future has for me.

			As I got more into football and fantasy sports, I sat with my friends every year experiencing our "homemade" draft that consisted of a google sheet attempting to track each pick and the organise the information about each player. Every year someone else in my friend group would have to run the draft and it became more of a job rather than a fun night.

			DraftNight is a web app that allows people to easily draft for fantasy football and then allows for easy exporting of the data to make the job of the league manager a lot easier.
